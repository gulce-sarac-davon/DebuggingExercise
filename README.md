# DebuggingExercise

I have first search a appropriate debugging tool for cordova .
The extension that I'll be using https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Msjsdiag.cordova-tools .
After I have configured the environment .(Note :I had to change the java_home path in local .profile file).

I have learned the basic debugging with this tutorial .
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qZBwhSlfOo

Basics about:
-Step over: moves on to next statement . DOES NOT go into call procesures
-Step into:if the statement includes a call procudure . Goes into the call procedure . Changing call stack adding current call
-Step out:Pops the call stack .Return execution to outer scope .

Debugging also helps with having in depth variable value knowledge . For example I wanted to see what Ä±mageUri was by watching variable I learned that current assigned value was "file:///data/user/0/com.pvpoyer.cameraplugintesting/cache/1641983334759.jpg"
